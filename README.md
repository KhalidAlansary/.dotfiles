# My Neovim Config

Welcome to my personal Neovim configuration repository! ðŸŽ‰ This setup is optimized for a buttery smooth and blazingly fast editing experience.

## Prerequisites

Before using this configuration, make sure you have the following installed:

- **ripgrep**
- **git**
- **node**
- **npm**

#### For my Arch Linux comrades:

```bash
sudo pacman -S ripgrep git nodejs npm
```
